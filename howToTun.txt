2) unzip this project intosame directory with the libigl installation directory (they will have the same parent directory).

3) Navigate to this project's build directory. To build the libigl binaries, type "cmake ..". To build this project, type "make".

4) To run, simply execute "./example_bin MESH_FILE_NAME". They have to be in the same directory.

NOTE: -Dijkstra's algorithm takes time for really big files (like 50k mesh ones) (around 50 minutes).
