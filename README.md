## Some Digital Geometry Processing Applications using LibIGL

- Libigl is a really lightweight and compact, compared to other alternatives, but since it is relatively new. For building and running applications, visit [libigl website](https://github.com/libigl/libigl)

- Their code styling guide is really useful (on libigl website).

- Dijkstra's algorithm takes time for really big files (like 50k mesh ones) (around 50 minutes)
